- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rnelson88
I'm an enthusiastic IT professional with a strong background in application and desktop support. I'm constantly expanding my skillset and particularly interested in transitioning into the cybersecurity field.
My focus is currently on network security, and I'm actively seeking knowledge in this domain. I'm taking the LetsDefend SOC Analyst course to gain valuable insights into security operations and incident response.
I'm actively looking for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects in the IT security field. I'm also interested in collaborating on projects that involve security automation, incident response, and vulnerability management.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or are interested in working together on a project. I'm always eager to connect with other security enthusiasts and learn from their experiences.
I look forward to connecting with you!
