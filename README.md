ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rnelson88! I'm a passionate IT professional with a strong application and desktop support background. I'm continuously enhancing my skill set and am keenly interested in transitioning into cybersecurity.

Currently, I'm focused on studying for my CCNA certification while delving deeper into network security. I'm also taking the LetsDefend SOC Analyst course to gain practical insights into security operations and incident response.

I'm eager to contribute to open-source IT security projects and collaborate on initiatives involving security automation, incident response, and vulnerability management.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or are interested in teaming up on a project. I'm always excited to connect with fellow security enthusiasts and exchange knowledge. Looking forward to connecting with you!"

Let me know if you'd like further refinements!
